# Casumo Dev Challenge

This is my entry in the Casumo Dev Challenge. I used [Phaser](https://phaser.io) as a game framework (it works over PIXIjs and gives some basic game structures like the StateManager or the GameObjectFactory). I adore OOP, so I decided to use ES6/ES2015 for the code, so I cloned a repository called "Phaser ES6 Boilerplate" that gives me some skeleton and some tools. As the browsers aren't able to run every ES6 new functionality (Modules, ejem...), the boilerplate uses itself [Babeljs](https://babeljs.io/) that compiles the ES6 code in something that every browser can execute.

The background music is from [Eric Matyas](http://soundimage.org).

The graphics were drawn by myself using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), so you can also see my abilities drawing. They were based on some Casumo comercials I saw in the Facebook account.

The game is completely responsive (I did the best I could do in the short time I had!)

The way to run the game is pretty easy, just follow the following instructions! ;-)

## Usage

You need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Run the game...

`npm start`

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!!!
